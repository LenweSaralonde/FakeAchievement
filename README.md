Fake Achievement
================
Create fake achievement / curve links to be used in chat messages to impress noobs, fake PGMs and make laugh your friends and the girls ! Also helpful to join a pickup group when requested to "link curve plz" so you can make it for real.

Usage
-----
`/fa <achievement> <date>`
* Achievement can be the achievement ID (retrieved from the WoWHead URL for instance) or any incomplete achievement link.
* Date is format is *DD*/*MM*/*YY*. Year is in 2-digit format representing the year of the 21st Century (ie 8/12/10 for the 8<sup>th</sup> december 2010)

Examples
--------
`/fa 4999 8/12/10`
`/fa [Realm First! Level 85] 8/12/10`

The achievement link is generated for the currently targeted player. If you don't have any target, the link is generated for your character. Gives spoofy results with NPCs.

Of course, this won't give you the achievement and the real achievement can be verified in the armory. This is just attended for fun and to shut those arrogant fake PGM's mouths.
