Fake Achievement
================
Create fake achievement / curve links for chat messages to impress noobs, fake PGMs and make laugh your friends and the girls!

Also helpful to join a pickup group when requested to "link curve plz" so you can make it for real.

Of course, this won't give you the achievement for real and the actual status can be verified in the armory by anyone.

Usage
-----
Target the player you want to generate the fake achievement for then type the following command:

`/fa <achievement> <date>`
* **Achievement** can be the achievement ID (retrieved from the WoWHead URL for instance) or any incomplete achievement link (shift + click from the achievement list).
* **Date** format is *DD*/*MM*/*YYYY* or *DD*/*MM*/*YY*. (ie 8/12/2010 for the 8<sup>th</sup> december 2010)

The achievement link is generated for the currently targeted player. If you don't have any target, the link is generated for your character.

Examples
--------
`/fa 4999 8/12/2010`

`/fa [Realm First! Level 85] 8/12/2010`
