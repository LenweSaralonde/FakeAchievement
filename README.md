Fake Achievement Classic
========================
Create fake achievement links for chat messages to impress noobs, fake PGMs and have fun with your friends!

Also helpful to join a pickup group when requested to "link achievement plz" so you can make it for real.

Of course, this won't give you the achievement for real and the actual status can be verified in the armory by anyone.

Fake Achievement only works on WotLK Classic since at Retail patch 9.1.5, WoW servers invalidate fake achievement links. Anyway, it's just a project I made in 1 hour for fun. If you liked it, give a try to my other useless therefore essential add-ons such as [Musician](https://musician.lenwe.io), I hope you'll like that!

Usage
-----
Target the player you want to generate the fake achievement for then type the following command:

`/fa <achievement> <date>`
* **Achievement** can be the achievement ID (retrieved from the WoWHead URL for instance) or any incomplete achievement link (shift + click from the achievement list).
* **Date** format is *DD*/*MM*/*YYYY* or *DD*/*MM*/*YY*. (ie 8/12/2010 for the 8<sup>th</sup> december 2010)

The achievement link is generated for the currently targeted player. If you don't have any target, the link is generated for your character.

To find the ID of an achievement, search for it on [WoWHead](https://www.wowhead.com/achievements) then grab the numeric ID from the URL.

`/fa [Invincible's Reins] 13/11/2008`

Save fake achievement links

To save fake achievement links in game, just save the /fa commands in macros and run them when needed.
